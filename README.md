# sCrypt Project Boilerplate

## Quickstart
```
npm install
npm test
```

## How to write test for a sCrypt contract

The major steps to write a sCrypt test are exemplified by `tests/demo.scrypttest.js`.

1. import / require `scrypttest` libary. 

```
import { buildContractClass } from 'scrypttest';
```


2. Use the imported function `buildContractClass` to get a reflected contract, which has same properties and methods as defined in the specified sCrypt contract.

```
const Demo = buildContractClass(path.join(__dirname, '../contracts/demo.scrypt'));
```

3. Initialize the contract.

```
demo = new Demo(4, 7);
```

4. Write tests for the instantiated contract as you would do in Javascript.

```
expect(demo.unlock(4 + 7)).to.equal(true);
```

## How to run tests locally

### Run using sCrypt Extension
Run unit tests file within the editor/explorer context menu.

**Note:** The test files must be suffixed by `.scrypttest.js` or `.scrypttest.ts`, otherwise the "Run sCrypt Test" option would not appear in the menu.

### Run from console
Tests could also be run from the console by executing `npm test`, just like regular Javascript/TypeScript tests.

## How to run tests remotely on testnet
When your tests succeed locally, you can run them on testnet.
1. Provide a private key with funds in `tests/runontestnet.js`

You can create a testnet wallet here: https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/bitcoinpaperwallet/generate-wallet.html?design=alt-testnet

You can then load that address using this faucet: https://faucet.bitcoincloud.net

```
const key = ''
```
2. `npm run testnet`
```
> scrypt_boilerplate@0.1.0 testnet ~/scrypt_boilerplate
> node tests/runontestnet.js
